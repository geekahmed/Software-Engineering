## Exercises
- Suggest the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used as a basis for managing the development of the following systems. Explain your answer according to the type of system being developed: 
	- A system to control antilock braking in a car
	- A virtual reality system to support software maintenance
	- A university accounting system that replaces an existing system
	- An interactive travel planning system that helps users plan journeys with the lowest environmental impact
- Incremental software development could be very effectively used for customers who do not have a clear idea about the systems needed for their operations. Discuss.
- Consider the integration and configuration process model shown in Figure 2.3. Explain why it is essential to repeat the requirements engineering activity in the process.
- Suggest why it is important to make a distinction between developing the user requirements and developing system requirements in the requirements engineering process.
- Using an example, explain why the design activities of architectural design, database design, interface design, and component design are interdependent.
- Explain why software testing should always be an incremental, staged activity. Are programmers the best people to test the programs that they have developed?
- Imagine that a government wants a software program that helps to keep track of the utilization of the country’s vast mineral resources. Although the requirements put forward by the government were not very clear, a software company was tasked with the development of a prototype. The government found the prototype impressive, and asked it be extended to be the actual system that would be used. Discuss the pros and cons of taking this approach.
- You have developed a prototype of a software system and your manager is very impressed by it. She proposes that it should be put into use as a production system, with new features added as required. This avoids the expense of system development and makes the system immediately useful. Write a short report for your manager explaining why prototype systems should not normally be used as production systems.
- . Suggest two advantages and two disadvantages of the approach to process assessment and improvement that is embodied in the SEI’s Capability Maturity framework.
- Historically, the introduction of technology has caused profound changes in the labor market and, temporarily at least, displaced people from jobs. Discuss whether the introduction of extensive process automation is likely to have the same consequences for software engineers. If you don’t think it will, explain why not. If you think that it will reduce job opportunities, is it ethical for the engineers affected to passively or actively resist the introduction of this technology?
