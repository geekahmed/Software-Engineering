# Chapter 1. Introduction
> The objectives of this chapter are to introduce software engineering and to provide a framework for understanding the rest of the book.
## Notes
### Section 1. Professional software development
- Software systems are abstract and intangible.
	- They are not constrained by the properties of materials, nor are they governed by physical laws or by manufacturing processes.
- Software engineering is intended to support professional software development rather than individual programming.
- There are two kinds of software product:
	- Generic products
	- Customized software
- Essential attributes of good software:
	- Acceptability
	- Dependability and security
	- Efficiency
	- Maintainability
- A software process is a sequence of activities that leads to the production of a software product.
- Software process has 4 fundamental activities:
	- Software specification
	- Software development
	- Software validation
	- Software evolution
- There are four related issues that affect many different types of software:
	- Heterogeneity
	- Business and social change
	- Security and trust
	- Scale
### Section 2. Software engineering ethics
- There are areas where standards of acceptable behavior are not bound by laws but by the more tenuous notion of professional responsibility.
	- ***Confidentiality:*** you should normally respect the confidentiality of your employers or clients regardless of whether or not a formal confidentiality agreement has been signed.
	- ***Competence:*** you should not misrepresent your level of competence. You should not knowingly accept work that is outside your competence.
	- ***Intellectual property rights:*** you should be aware of local laws governing the use of intellectual property such as patents and copyright. You should be careful to ensure that the intellectual property of employers and clients is protected.
	- ***Computer misuse:*** you should not use your technical skills to misuse other people’s computers. Computer misuse ranges from relatively trivial (game playing on an employer’s machine) to extremely serious (dissemination of viruses or other malware).
## Exercises
- Explain why professional software that is developed for a customer is not simply the programs that have been developed and delivered.
	- A professional software is accompanied by many other attachements and activites. The customer gets documentation, support, and operations. Also, there are design models, requirements drafts, testing plans.
- What is the most important difference between generic software product development and custom software development? What might this mean in practice for users of generic software products?
	- **Generic products** These are stand-alone systems that are produced by a development organization and sold on the open market to any customer who is able to buy them. Examples of this type of product include apps for mobile devices, software for PCs such as databases, word processors, drawing packages, and project management tools. This kind of software also includes “vertical” applications designed for a specific market such as library information systems, accounting systems, or systems for maintaining dental records.
	- **Customized software** These are systems that are commissioned by and developed for a particular customer. A software contractor designs and implements the software especially for that customer. Examples of this type of software include control systems for electronic devices, systems written to support a particular business process, and air traffic control systems.
- Briefly discuss why it is usually cheaper in the long run to use software engineering methods and techniques for software systems.
	- Software engineering techniques and methods are previously tried in developing many software systems in different times. So, these methods gurantee best results regarding the cost and effiency.
- Software engineering is not only concerned with issues like system heterogeneity, business and social change, trust, and security, but also with ethical issues affecting the domain. Give some examples of ethical issues that have an impact on the software engineering domain.
	- Most software engineers are talented people in addition they have deep knowledge in relatively new devices to the humanity. Some software engineers which are not honest may decieve normal people and steal their money.
- Based on your own knowledge of some of the application types discussed in Section 1.1.2, explain, with examples, why different application types require specialized software engineering techniques to support their design and development.
	- Each application type has its own constraints and challenges. Having one line to develop all softwares is not a good indicator. For example, embedded systems have to be developed in a way to reduce power consumbtion and cost. On the other hand, a web server for elections has to developed to be scaled and bear many users in addtion of high security constraints and limitations.
-  Explain why the fundamental software engineering principles of process, dependability, requirements management, and reuse are relevant to all types of software system.
	- Because of all software systems have common quality attributes, including availability, modifiability, performance, security and safety, testability and usability, the fundamental software ideas provides common solutions or tactics to support those qualities.
- Explain how electronic connectivity between various development teams can support software engineering activities.
	- The key enabler of team collaboration is communication. Without an effective communication medium, collaborating with others on a project is almost impossible.
- Noncertified individuals are still allowed to practice software engineering. Discuss some of the possible drawbacks of this.
	- Non-certified individuals can misapply software engineering processes, they might make the software ineffective for what its designed for this could lead to a waste of resources.
	- Certified individuals may have to work along with non-certified individuals. This could give rise to disagreeing ideas about security and development processes.
	- At worst, these non-certified individuals can be absolutely counterproductive, create pointless confusion, or make else simple code awfully complex as the confused programmer, they try to shoehorn in activities where they do not belong.
- The “Drone Revolution” is currently being debated and discussed all over the world. Drones are unmanned flying machines that are built and equipped with various kinds of software systems that allow them to see, hear, and act. Discuss some of the societal challenges of building such kinds of systems.
	- Drones introduce privacy issues for individuals and the whole country. For example, a man with a drone may take photos of you from your home without your permission. In addtion, it may photo some military places.
