# Software Engineering
This repository presents my learning and reading process for the well-known book by Ian Sommerville "Software Engineering - 10th Edition".

Each chapter is presented as a directory that contains a README file that comprimises the notes of the chapter and any other helper videos. Also, it contains a directory which has the solutions for chapter exercises. Not all exercises will be solved in a time. It is an ongoing process.
