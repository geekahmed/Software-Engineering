	- Dependability and security
	- Efficiency
	- Maintainability
- A software process is a sequence of activities that leads to the production of a software product.
- Software process has 4 fundamental activities:
	- Software specification
	- Software development
	- Software validation
	- Software evolution
- There are four related issues that affect many different types of software:
	- Heterogeneity
	- Business and social change
